Current Todo List:
1. Order Creation Validation: think of extreme cases, such as creating a iceberg order, where the total quantity is less than what the user wants to display. Think of other extreme cases, and make sure that these are incorporated in the validation phase.
2. Automatic Order ID Generation - remove ID assignment from the constructor of classes - this should be done automatically 

DONE:
- Automatic Timestamp Generation
- Removed Timestamp from Order Constructor
- Removed ID from Order Constructor
- Remove CPP References from Old Constructors
- Fix the boolean variables in the Stop Orders
- Remove the extra hiddenQty variable from Iceberg Order
